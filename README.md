A modern, Art-Deco–inspired website for an **Independent Registered Investment Adviser (RIA)**.  
This repo contains the **static frontend** (Home, Services, Insights, FAQ, CTA, Disclosures, Footer, Mobile Nav).  
Backend (forms, calendaring, CMS, analytics) can be added later.

> **Compliance-first:** Prominent **FINRA BrokerCheck** link, **SEC-required disclosures** in footer, and **CCPA** “Do Not Sell” link.
